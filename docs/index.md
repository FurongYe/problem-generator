# Problem generator

The problem generator has various [subcommands](subcommands.md) to switch between input modes: `configuration folder`, `codomain folder`, `configuration file`, and `codomain file`.
 
The file structure of the configuration, codomain, and (output) problem files is listed in [file_structures](file_structures.md).
